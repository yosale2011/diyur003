refactor(logic): modularize monthly totals calculation and enhance daily map processing

- Introduced helper functions `_build_daily_map`, `_calculate_chain_wages`, and `_process_daily_map` to streamline the calculation of monthly totals and improve code readability.
- Removed redundant code from `calculate_person_monthly_totals` by leveraging the new helper functions for building daily maps and processing daily data.
- Enhanced type hints and added additional imports for better type handling.
- Improved overall structure and maintainability of the logic for calculating employee payment summaries.
